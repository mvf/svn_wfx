svn_wfx - Subversion File System Plugin for Total Commander

Copyright (C) 2010 Matthias von Faber

License: GPLv3. See COPYING.

This simple plugin allows the twin-panel file manager Total Commander
(www.ghisler.com) to browse Subversion repositories. SVN commands like log,
blame etc. are provided via TortoiseSVN (tortoisesvn.tigris.org).

After installation, Network Neighbourhood inside Total Commander will contain
a flashy new directory called "Subversion". Running the "Edit Locations"
file inside will open the configuration file (svn_wfx.ini in your wincmd.ini
directory) in your text editor (EDITOR environment variable)
or Notepad as fallback. Here you can set up your Subversion locations
(detailed instructions are provided in the file when you first open it). Once
you are done you have to manually refresh the directory listing (Ctrl+R) to
have the changes show up in TC.

You can now explore your SVN repository from Total Commander. SVN commands
are available via TC's command line (Ctrl+E). As the TortoiseSVN people have
already done all the hard work, svn_wfx uses TortoiseProc for displaying logs
etc.

Currently the following commands are supported:

  co    [srcdir] - Open Checkout dialog
  blame  <file>  - Open Blame dialog
  log    [path]  - Open Log window
  props  [path]  - Open SVN properties dialog
  rb     [path]  - Open Repository Browser
  rg     [path]  - Open Revision Graph

If the parameter is omitted the command will be applied to the current
Subversion directory. Entering an invalid command will pop up a message box
with a brief list of valid commands.

Diff is NYI as it requires additional server communication. For now you can
just diff from the TSVN log dialog.
